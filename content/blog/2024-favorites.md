2024 has had a LOT going on for me, hitting so many points across the spectrum. Now at the end of it, I've taken on many learned lessons and have grown in ways I haven't imagined. But - this isn't what this post is about! In here, I wanted to highlight some pieces that I've discovered through the year, either new or old, that have helped shaped me and continue to provide a good impact on myself :)

# Music
Guess what, I listened to a LOT of music this year. It definitely came about differently, especially as I've gotten to listening to so many DJ mixes noww (like I got a SoundCloud subscription just for that y'all lol).

## Albums, LPs
### Nala Sinephro - Endlessness (2024)
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/endlessness.jpg" title="" width="50%" >}}
I stumbled upon this one while travelling around Germany back in September, I remember skimming through a review that made point on the heavy intertwines of jazz and ambient electronic styles. That was enough for me to give it a listen, and I was so glad that I did. I've only been able to listen to this album from start to finish, jumping in any other way doesn't feel right.

This album feels so cleansing, it allowed me to feel tranquility and can easily put you in a meditative state.

### Kapote - Italomania Vol. 2 (2024)
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/italomania.png" title="" width="50%" >}}
I've listened to Italo Disco on and off for the past few years now, being used to it growing up from my parents. I kind of surprised myself this year by doubling down efforts in this space once I began to explore the vast nature of it, and this EP really helped shape it for me. They boldly go about stating that they're "ITALIAN" Disco and not ITALO, but you can't help but feel the same energy pulse throughout this EP. It's such a fun project, especially with tracks like "SessoSpaghetti" and "La Musica" feeling so infectious and fresh.

### Doechii - Alligator Bites Never Heal (2024)
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/doechii.jpg" title="" width="50%" >}}
Yeah I'm getting on the bandwagon just like everyone else, very late as well! But damn this is REALLY something. I honestly had my suspicions that it was just going to feel flat to me, but the first listen through proved me so wrong. This whole album feels like it pulls from the prodcution ideas of Bahamadia and, of course, Lauryn Hill, while providing such a grizly taste from Doechii herself. Definitely not done listening here, but I'm real excited for what she gives next.

### Kelela - RAVE:N, The Remixes (2024)
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/a0527179828_10.jpg" title="" width="50%" >}}
I enjoyed Raven so much last year, the etherereal soundscape Kelela brought on was amazing. I will say though... I think RAVE:N tops it #ngl. I usually miss out on remix albums purely for the sake of not wanting to hear a bunch of lightly tweaked tracks get thrown into a big ass compilation album, but this is such an exception. I've been coming back to this one plenty throughout the year, the various heavy edits on tracks like Missed Call and Raven are transformative. The JD.REID remix of Holier is so satisfying.

### POiSON GiRL FRiEND - MELTING MOMENT (1992)
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/51fwrLj9qgL._UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg" title="" width="50%" >}}
Another one I just stumbled on, I think this time it was some review on Bandcamp? The melanchony nature of the album resonated with me at the beginning of 2024, but felt in many ways very uplifting. It felt as if it's describing to me that "Yes, times are tough now, but you've made it through before, so why not make it through now?" Highly recommend giving this a chance.

### Robyn - Honey (2018)
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/71PatIUr9fL.jpg" title="" width="50%" >}}
Pop music is not where I find myself...except for the occasional Charli XCX of course (Charli is her best album). Besides that not much. I, yet again, stumbled upon Honey back in the spring, and fell for it very quickly. It's pop alright...but I haven't heard it like this before. This felt much gentler in tone than what I'm used to, while providing the essence of pop all throughout. "Beach2k20" is so himbo/bimbo energy, what a fun ass track. I feel airheaded with this one lmfao.

### Channel Tres - Head Rush (2024)
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/Channel-Tres-Head-Rush.jpg" title="" width="50%" >}}
I heard so little about this album!! I had such a great time listening to this one. Channel brought on darker chops for a good part of the album, bringing on some rapping that I wasn't expecting. The staple energy he brings with his music was very much there though, and was satisfying the whole way through.

### Kendrick Lamar - GNX (2024)
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/gnx.webp" title="" width="50%" >}}
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/h0BxjPmT.webp" title="" width="50%" >}}


### Pet Shop Boys - Introspective (1988)
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/Introspective.jpg" title="" width="50%" >}}
Easily album of the year for me. Yeah yeah it came out 36 years ago, but I've been on a heavy kick of Pet Shop Boys this year. This album is THE one that defines them, putting that out there right now. From beginning to end, you get the full scope as to what the duo can bring musically.
