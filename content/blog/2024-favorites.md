2024 has had a LOT going on for me, hitting so many points across the spectrum. Now at the end of it, I've taken on many learned lessons and have grown in ways I haven't imagined. But - this isn't what this post is about! In here, I wanted to highlight some pieces that I've discovered through the year, either new or old, that have helped shaped me and continue to provide a good impact on myself :)

# Albums, LPs

## Nala Sinephro - Endlessness (2024)
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/endlessness.jpg" title="" width="50%" >}}
I stumbled upon this one while travelling around Germany back in September, I remember skimming through a review that made point on the heavy intertwines of jazz and ambient electronic styles. That was enough for me to give it a listen, and I was so glad that I did. I've only been able to listen to this album from start to finish, jumping in any other way doesn't feel right.

This album feels so cleansing, it allowed me to feel tranquility and can easily put you in a meditative state.

## Kapote - Italomania Vol. 2 (2024)
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/italomania.png" title="" width="50%" >}}
I've listened to Italo Disco on and off for the past few years now, being used to it growing up from my parents. I kind of surprised myself this year by doubling down efforts in this space once I began to explore the vast nature of it, and this EP really helped shape it for me. They boldly go about stating that they're "ITALIAN" Disco and not ITALO, but you can't help but feel the same energy pulse throughout this EP.

It's such a fun project, especially with tracks like "SessoSpaghetti" and "La Musica" feeling so infectious and fresh.

## Doechii - Alligator Bites Never Heal (2024)
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/doechii.jpg" title="" width="50%" >}}
Yeah I'm getting on the bandwagon just like everyone else, very late as well! But damn this is REALLY something. I honestly had my suspicions that it was just going to feel flat to me, but the first listen through proved me so wrong. This whole album feels like it pulls from the production ideas of Bahamadia and, of course, Lauryn Hill, while providing such a grisly taste from Doechii herself.

Definitely not done listening here, but I'm real excited for what she puts out next.

## Kelela - RAVE:N, The Remixes (2024)
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/a0527179828_10.jpg" title="" width="50%" >}}
I enjoyed Raven so much last year, the ethereal soundscape Kelela brought on was amazing. I will say though… I think RAVE:N tops it #ngl. I usually miss out on remix albums purely for the sake of not wanting to hear a bunch of lightly tweaked tracks get thrown into a big ass compilation album, but this is such an exception.

I’ve been coming back to this one plenty throughout the year, the various heavy edits on tracks like Missed Call and Raven are transformation. The JD.REID remix of Holier is real hot and mystical. 

##  Herdersmat part 41​-​44 (2024)
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/Herdersmat.png" title="" width="50%" >}}
If I had to select an album that defined my grain of techno, it'd be this one. It's raw, heavy and relentless, everything I strive for with my techno-driven sets. Tracks like Esbarare rough and quick on its feet, while tracks like Oxygeno provide a more hypnotic realm to cruise away in. This comp has all and everything in between.

## POiSON GiRL FRiEND - MELTING MOMENT (1992)
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/51fwrLj9qgL._UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg" title="" width="50%" >}}
Another one I just stumbled on, I think this time it was from some review on Bandcamp? The melancholy nature of the album resonated with me at the beginning of 2024, but felt in many ways very uplifting. It felt as if it's describing to me that "Yes, times are tough now, but you've made it through before, so why not make it through now?" Highly recommend giving this a chance.

## Robyn - Honey (2018)
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/71PatIUr9fL.jpg" title="" width="50%" >}}
Pop music is not where I find myself...except for the occasional Charli XCX of course (Charli is her best album). Besides that not much. I, yet again, stumbled upon Honey back in the spring, and fell for it very quickly. It's pop alright...but I haven't heard it like this before. This felt much gentler in tone than what I'm used to, while providing the essence of pop all throughout.

"Beach2k20" is so himbo/bimbo energy, what a fun ass track. I feel like an airhead with this one lmfao.

## Channel Tres - Head Rush (2024)
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/Channel-Tres-Head-Rush.jpg" title="" width="50%" >}}
I heard so little about this album!! I had such a great time listening to this one. Channel brought on darker chops for a good part of the album, bringing on some rapping that I wasn't expecting. The staple energy he brings with his music was very much there though, and was satisfying the whole way through.

## Kendrick Lamar - GNX (2024)
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/gnx.webp" title="" width="50%" >}}
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/h0BxjPmT.webp" title="" width="50%" >}}

## Pet Shop Boys - Introspective (1988)
{{< figure src="/blog/blog_images/2024-favorites/Introspective.jpg" title="" width="50%" >}}
Easily album of the year for me. Yeah, yeah it came out 36 years ago, but I’ve been on a heavy kick of Pet Shop Boys this year. This album is THE one that defines them, putting that out there right now. From beginning to end, you get the full scope as to what the duo can bring musically. 

Getting into this over the summer, it felt defining for what I was experiencing and what is to come. It feels hot, dampening, mysterious and adventurous all the way through. Recommend listening to this one from front to back.

# Singles/EPs
I have TONS of singles and EPs that I came to love this year. Instead of writing about them, have a playlist full of it:

But! I have plenty that I've come across in Bandcamp as well:

# Mixes
My main source of music was not Spotify, but instead was internet radio stations and SoundCloud for recorded sets. It helped me find the path I want to take as a DJ and has allowed me to find comfort in certain genres :)

# Last Thoughts
Like I said, 2024 was a LOT to handle. There has been a lot to learn, and I'm ready to experience 2025 with these new learnings and skills.

Glad I finally got this blog set up! I've been wanting to for the longest time now, but wanted to do it in a way that was 1) using my already existing knowledge of Git and very amateur knowledge of webdev (shoutout to Hugo frfr) and 2) be cheap. I've been successful in both now:) Definitely not my favorite way of coding as I'm an embedded fella through and through, but it is fun playing around with the embedded players throughout onnamule.net.

Expect more here in the coming months, and if you got all the way to the end here, then thanks for reading through:)
