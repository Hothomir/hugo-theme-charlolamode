# What is an "Onna Mule"?
Onna Mule began in 2022 a hub for all works by Bartosz Jaskulski. Currently, Onna Mule shows the following:

- Graphical Works
- DJ Works

More may add on, or some might change.

If interested in some commissioned graphic work, feel free to reach out to me at my [email](mailto::jaskula242@gmail.com) or on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/onna_mule.arts/) page. Portfolio can be seen on the "Graphics" tab :)
